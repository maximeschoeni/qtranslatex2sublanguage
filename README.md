# qtranslatex2sublanguage

Require plugin [Locomotive](https://github.com/reaktivstudios/locomotive).

Create a batch for export post fields (post_title, post_content, post_excerpt) and term names from qTranslateX to Sublanguage.

Usage:
1. Make sure to backup your database. Changes are irreversible.
2. Install both plugins.
3. run batches in "Tools > Batches"

Sublanguage and qTranslateX plugins do not need to be active during migration. Sublanguage languages codes (en, fr, de, it, es, etc.) must match with qTranslateX's.
